## Commitizen
We will use commitizen for all commit messages. The repository is set up to use
commitizen via the `.czrc` file. If you have commitizen already installed globally,
you can use it to commit for this repository.  

If you do not have commitizen installed, follow the instructions on their 
[GitHub](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).  

If you do not have npm installed, you will need to do that before installing commitizen.
npm is distributed with Node.js. Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
